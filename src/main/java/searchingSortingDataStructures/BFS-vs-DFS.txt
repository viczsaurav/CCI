- BFS (Breadth-first search): -
-------------------------------

Advantages:

- A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node.
- A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.

Disadvantages

- A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.


-----------------------------
- DFS (Depth-first search): -
-----------------------------
Advantages:

- Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
- Depth-first search can be easily implemented with recursion.

Disadvantages

- A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
